# Practical Password Cracking - Hardware, Tools, Methods and AI

The presentation aims to teach a methodology and mindset for password cracking that is applicable to all types of passwords. It emphasizes that while having advanced hardware such as powerful GPUs and cloud infrastructure can enhance the process, it is not a necessity for success—most passwords can be efficiently cracked using minimal hardware. The key takeaway is that password cracking is accessible and not inherently complicated with the right knowledge. The outcome is prooving out the described methodology using the Have I Been Pwned dataset while using tried-and-true techniques and novel AI-based LLM tooling.

# How is this useful?

Password cracking is a vital skill in cybersecurity because it provides concrete evidence of the risks associated with poor security practices. Demonstrating the ease with which passwords can be compromised has a significant impact during cybersecurity assessments, emphasizing the importance of strong security measures. In penetration testing, obtaining initial access and escalating privileges often hinges on the ability to crack captured password hashes. The ability to successfully crack these hashes can be the deciding factor in the outcome of a security assessment.

Furthermore, by auditing an organization's NTDS.dit file—a database that stores Active Directory data including password hashes—security professionals can evaluate the effectiveness of the organization's password policies and technical controls. Whether these policies are robust or lacking, the audit provides clear evidence of the current state of security.

In the context of cybersecurity operations, being adept at password cracking within the constraints of time and resources is crucial. It's not just about breaking passwords, but doing so efficiently and effectively in the real-world scenarios that cyber operators face. This skill is an essential part of a cybersecurity professional's toolkit, allowing them to identify vulnerabilities, test security measures, and help organizations strengthen their defenses against potential breaches.

# How does this help the good guys?

The skill of password cracking serves as a powerful tool for cybersecurity advocates to demonstrate the real-world consequences of inadequate security measures. When cyber professionals present the results of security engagements—particularly the ease of password exploitation—it can be a persuasive wake-up call for corporate leadership. Such demonstrations often lead to rapid organizational changes, as they make the abstract threat of cyber attacks tangible and understandable, even for non-technical leaders.

By clearly illustrating the vulnerabilities in their systems through password cracking, cybersecurity professionals can effectively communicate the urgency and necessity for improved security. This, in turn, can catalyze a stronger commitment to cybersecurity within the organization, often resulting in increased focus and resources dedicated to bolstering defenses.

The ability to crack passwords is more than just a technical skill; it is a means of translating the complex language of cybersecurity into clear and actionable information that can drive decision-making at the highest levels. Therefore, mastering the art of password cracking is not just beneficial for penetrating systems in a test environment, but it's also critical for advocating for stronger security practices—helping the "good guys" build a more resilient posture against cyber threats.
